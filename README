 = Simple Deduplication Benchmark =

 Usually Benchmarks of Deduplication systems use real-life data of production systems. Due to privacy concerns, this benchmarks are not publically available.

This projects provides the first (to my knowledge) benchmark for data deduplcation storage systems that does not use any private data. 

However, the benchmark is not without limitations. The most obviously is that the data set must fit in the main memory of the client.

The generator sub project is used to generate traffic data. The runner subproject is used to write the generated traffic data as fast as possible to the deduplication system.
